### A digital gift for Asma — my Wild Rose 🌹

A is for the 🪨 Anchor you became —  
when my world spun in stories too soft to stay 🌬️📚.  
You taught me that even reality,  
when shared with the right soul 🤝,  
can be a kind of fairytale ✨.

S is for the Silence 🤫 you never feared —  
you listened to my chaos 🌪️ without flinching.  
You held space, gave breath 🌿,  
and never once asked me to shrink 🧸.

M is for the 🌙 Moonlight you carry —  
mature, healing, never blinding 🕯️.  
You shine steady, soft 🌾,  
pulling tides I didn’t know still moved inside me 🌊.

A is for Always ♾️ —  
because no matter where the plot turns 📖,  
you’ll always be my favorite chapter 💌.
